# Gemini AI Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the Gemini AI integration implemented in the My Finance Manager backend to automatically extract financial information from receipts and PDFs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **Apache Tika**: For better file processing and text extraction
- **Jackson**: For JSON processing of AI responses
- **Standard HTTP Client**: For calling Gemini AI APIs

### 2. New Classes Created

#### GeminiAIService
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/my_finance_manager_backend/service/GeminiAIService.java`
- **Purpose**: Core service that handles AI processing of uploaded files
- **Features**:
  - Supports both images (JPEG, PNG) and PDFs
  - Uses Gemini Vision API for images
  - Uses Gemini Pro API for text-based documents
  - Extracts structured financial data
  - Includes fallback pattern matching for failed AI responses

#### GeminiConfig
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/my_finance_manager_backend/config/GeminiConfig.java`
- **Purpose**: Configuration class for Gemini AI settings
- **Features**:
  - Centralized API configuration
  - HTTP client configuration with timeouts
  - Environment-based configuration

#### ReceiptDTO
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/my_finance_manager_backend/dto/ReceiptDTO.java`
- **Purpose**: Data Transfer Object for receipt responses
- **Features**:
  - Structured response format
  - Includes both file metadata and AI-extracted information
  - Error handling fields

### 3. Updated Existing Classes

#### Receipt Model
- **Added Fields**:
  - `extractedText`: Raw AI response text
  - `merchantName`: Business/store name
  - `amount`: Transaction amount
  - `currency`: Transaction currency
  - `transactionDate`: Date of transaction
  - `category`: AI-classified category
  - `description`: Transaction description
  - `aiConfidence`: Processing confidence score

#### ReceiptService
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Automatic AI processing on file upload
  - Integration with GeminiAIService
  - Error handling for AI processing failures
  - Complete CRUD operations for receipts

#### ReceiptController
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/receipts/{id}` - Get receipt by ID
  - `GET /api/receipts` - Get all receipts
  - `DELETE /api/receipts/{id}` - Delete receipt
  - `POST /api/receipts/{id}/reprocess` - Reprocess with AI

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### application.properties
- **Gemini AI Settings**:
  - API key configuration
  - API endpoint URLs
  - Model selection
- **File Upload Settings**:
  - Maximum file size: 10MB
  - Supported file types

## How It Works

### 1. File Upload Flow
1. User uploads receipt/image via frontend
2. `ReceiptController.uploadReceipt()` receives the file
3. `ReceiptService.saveReceipt()` processes the file
4. `GeminiAIService.extractInformationFromFile()` analyzes the file
5. AI extracts financial information and returns structured data
6. Receipt is saved with extracted information
7. Response includes both file metadata and AI results

### 2. AI Processing
- **Images**: Sent directly to Gemini Vision API
- **PDFs**: Text extracted first, then sent to Gemini Pro API
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent extraction
- **Response Parsing**: JSON extraction with fallback pattern matching

### 3. Data Extraction
The AI extracts the following information:
- **Merchant Name**: Business/store identification
- **Amount**: Transaction value
- **Currency**: Transaction currency
- **Date**: Transaction date
- **Category**: Automatic classification (Food, Transportation, etc.)
- **Description**: Transaction details

## API Endpoints

### Receipt Management
```
POST   /api/receipts/upload          # Upload and process receipt
GET    /api/receipts/{id}            # Get receipt by ID
GET    /api/receipts                 # Get all receipts
DELETE /api/receipts/{id}            # Delete receipt
POST   /api/receipts/{id}/reprocess  # Reprocess with AI
```

### Request Format
```json
POST /api/receipts/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [receipt image or PDF]
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "fileName": "receipt.jpg",
  "fileType": "image/jpeg",
  "fileSize": 1024000,
  "uploadedAt": "2025-08-31T18:00:00",
  "processed": true,
  "extractedText": "AI extracted text...",
  "merchantName": "Walmart",
  "amount": 45.67,
  "currency": "USD",
  "transactionDate": "08/31/2025",
  "category": "Shopping",
  "description": "Grocery purchase",
  "aiConfidence": "85%"
}
```

## Error Handling

### AI Processing Failures
- Files are still saved with basic metadata
- Error messages are stored in `extractedText` field
- `processed` flag is set to `false`
- System continues to function normally

### File Validation
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Supported file types validation
- Graceful handling of unsupported formats

## Security Features

- CORS enabled for frontend integration
- File size limits to prevent abuse
- Input validation on all endpoints
- No sensitive data exposure in logs

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `GeminiAIServiceTest`: Tests AI service functionality
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- File handling validation

### Integration Tests
- Database schema validation
- Service layer integration
- Controller endpoint testing

## Performance Considerations

- HTTP client with configurable timeouts
- Async processing capability (can be extended)
- Efficient file handling with streams
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Async Processing**: Queue-based background processing
2. **Batch Processing**: Multiple file uploads
3. **Caching**: AI response caching for similar documents
4. **Advanced Categorization**: Machine learning-based category refinement
5. **Receipt Validation**: AI-powered receipt authenticity checking
6. **Multi-language Support**: International receipt processing

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN integration for file storage
- Microservices architecture for AI processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Verify Gemini API key in application.properties
2. **File Processing Failures**: Check file format and size
3. **Database Connection**: Verify MySQL connection settings
4. **Memory Issues**: Monitor JVM heap size for large file processing

### Debug Information
- Enable debug logging in application.properties
- Check application logs for detailed error messages
- Verify database schema updates
- Test API endpoints with Postman or similar tools

## Conclusion

The Gemini AI integration provides a robust, scalable solution for automatic financial data extraction from receipts and documents. The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices and includes comprehensive error handling, testing, and documentation.

The system is production-ready and can be easily extended with additional AI capabilities and business logic as needed.
